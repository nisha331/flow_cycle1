    <h1 class="heading">Menstrual Cycle</h1>
    <div class="information">
        <div class="inf">
          <p class="exclaim">Its all about knowing yourself better, and <b>say goodbye to the unexpected dates!</b></p>
          <p>Your menstrual cycle days begin from the first day of your last period and end on the first day of your next. The length of normal menstrual cycle days is different for different women, but the average length of a cycle can be anywhere between 24 to 38 days.</p>
          <p>The length of period cycle days is also dynamic. It keeps changing between your <b>menarche </b>(when your periods first arrive during puberty) and <b>menopause</b> (when your periods stop forever).</p>
          <p>The key elements involved in and affecting women's menstrual cycle is a complex interaction between your brain, female hormones: oestrogen and progesterone, the uterus, and the ovaries.</p>
          <p>The pituitary gland situated at the base of your brain signals your ovaries to secrete oestrogen and progesterone that prepare the body for a possible pregnancy. Thus, commencing the menstrual period cycle which progresses in four main phases:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Menstruation:</b></li>
            <p></p>
            <p>During this phase, a menstrual fluid consisting of blood, mucus, and the cells of the uterine lining is eliminated through the vaginal opening. This is your period. It can last anywhere between 2 to 7 days.</p>
            <li><b>The Follicular Phase:</b></li>
            <p></p>
            <p>The follicular phase of your menstrual cycle begins from the first day of your period and lasts up until ovulation. In the course of this phase, oestrogen levels rise, and the ovaries prepare for the release of an egg for possible fertilization.
              The follicular phase also stimulates the phase where the uterine lining begins to build again.</p>
            <li><b>Ovulation:</b></li>
            <p></p>
            <p>In this phase, ovaries release the egg. It travels through the fallopian tubes and implants itself into the lining along the walls of your uterus.
              This phase usually occurs around two weeks prior to your periods. During this process, the oestrogen level peaks and drops just shortly after.
              The typical life span of this egg is about 24 hours. Unless it is fertilised by a sperm cell during this window, it dies and is shed along with the uterine lining.</p>
            <li><b>The Luteal Phase:</b></li>
            <p>The phase that occurs between ovulation and the first day of your period is called the luteal phase. This phase sees a rise in the level of progesterone, required to maintain the thickness of the uterine lining to nurture the fertilised egg. Now, if during that time, pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels drop. This causes the uterine lining to break down and shed away, along with other menstrual fluid.</p>
