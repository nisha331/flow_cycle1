          <p class="exclaim">Ovulation is the process where a mature egg is released from the ovary and travels down the fallopian tube, where it may become fertilized by sperm. Here is some information regarding ovulation, including how it happens, when it typically occurs, and some precautions to keep in mind:</p>
          <br>
          <div class="video">
            <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/usEIVynA0Ck?start=6&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li><b>How does ovulation happen?</b></li>
            <p>Ovulation is triggered by a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, which causes the follicle in the ovary to burst and release the egg. This typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle, but can vary depending on the length of the cycle and individual factors such as stress, illness, and hormonal imbalances.</p>
            <li><b>When does ovulation occur?</b></li>
              <p>Ovulation typically occurs once a month in women who have regular menstrual cycles. The exact timing of ovulation can vary from woman to woman and can be influenced by factors such as age, stress, illness, and hormonal imbalances. It is possible for some women to ovulate more than once in a cycle, although this is relatively rare.
              </p>
              <li><b>Symptoms of ovulation</b></li>
              <p>During the period, it’s possible for you to experience a variety of ovulation symptoms. Each woman feels these symptoms at a different degree of intensity.

                .These are the most common ovulation symptoms:
                
                <i>Cervical mucus changes,
                <ii>Heightened sense of smell,
                <iii>Breast soreness or tenderness,
                <iv>Pelvic or abdominal pain,
                <v>Light spotting or discharge,
                <vi>Libido changes,
                <vii>Changes in the cervix.</p>
              <li ><b>What are some precautions to keep in mind during ovulation?</b></li>
              <p>
                If you are trying to conceive, it is important to have intercourse during the days leading up to and including ovulation, as this is when the egg is most likely to be fertilized. However, it is important to also use contraception if you are not trying to conceive, as ovulation can occur unpredictably and sperm can survive for several days in the reproductive tract.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, some women experience symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness, and mood changes during ovulation, which can be uncomfortable or inconvenient. Over-the-counter pain relievers and other remedies may help alleviate these symptoms.
              </p>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>Finally, it is important to remember that ovulation does not always result in pregnancy, and there are many factors that can influence fertility. If you have concerns about your fertility or are having difficulty conceiving, it is recommended that you speak with your healthcare provider.</p>
