          <div class="question">
            <li>What is a period and why do we have them?</li>
            <svg width="15" height="10" viewBox="0 0 42 25">

          <div class="answer">
            <p>Simply put: A period is when a woman’s body releases tissue it no longer needs. This tissue comes from
              the uterus, which is where a baby (fetus) can develop in the female body. Every month or so, the uterus
              lining gets thicker to prepare for a fertilized egg if the woman becomes pregnant. If the egg doesn’t get
              fertilized, that lining is released from the body as blood through the vagina. This monthly process is
              called menstruation or a period.
              So when a girl has her period, her body is just getting rid of a small amount of blood and some unneeded
              tissue. It is a natural, normal body process for all females as they become women and mature physically.

          <div class="answer">
            <p>The actual flow of your period doesn’t feel like much when it’s happening. Chances are, you won’t even
              feel it coming out. When you actually start your period, you may feel some dampness in your private area —
              this may be caused by a few spots of blood on your underwear.

          </div>

          <div class="answer">
            <p>It shouldn’t! Menstrual odor happens when menstrual fluid comes in contact with air. When menstrual fluid
              is absorbed within the vagina, like through a tampon, it is not exposed to the air, so there shouldn’t be
              an odor. If you’re feeling worried, just be sure to change your pads and tampons frequently to help keep
              odor at bay.

          </div>

          <div class="answer">
            <p>Menstruation itself doesn’t hurt, but some girls and women get cramps or other symptoms during their
              periods that may be uncomfortable. This is typically due to the hormones your body releases during
              menstruation that cause the uterus to contract so it can shed it’s lining.

            <p>Lots of girls have the same concern. Your mom will be one of your best resources when you have questions
              about your period, so try to start the conversation yourself! Know that she will be understanding and
              helpful. Actually, she may be your best friend during this time in your life. Still don’t feel like you
              can talk to your mom? An aunt, friend’s mom or older sister are also great women to ask.

              Some women may stop menstruation by the time they're 35 years old, and others may not stop until their
              late 50s.</p>
