        <p class="exclaim">Here's to all the women out there!</p>
        <p class="exclaim"><b>You ROCK!</b></p>
        <p>Here's to how you can lead a better and healthy Lifestyle.</p>
        <ul class="health">
          <li><b>Follow a Heart-Healthy Diet</b></li>
          <p></p>
          <p>There's an easy recipe if your goal is to keep away problems like heart disease and strokes.
            <ul>
            <li>Eat more fruits and veggies.</li>
            
            <li>Choose whole grains.</li> 
            <li>Try brown rice instead of white.</li>
            <li>Switch to whole wheat pasta.</li>
            <li>Choose lean proteins like poultry, fish, beans, and legumes.</li>
            <li>Cut down on processed foods, sugar, salt, and saturated fat.</li>
            
            </p>
          </ul>
          <li><b>Exercise EveryDay</b></li>
          <p></p>
          <p>The more active you are, the better. Exercise boosts your heart health, builds muscle and bone strength, and wards off health problems.

            Aim for 2 and a half hours of moderate activity, like brisk walking or dancing, every week. If you're OK with vigorous exercise, stick to 1 hour and 15 minutes a week of things like running or playing tennis. Add a couple of days of strength training, too.
            
            If you're busy, try short bursts of activity throughout the day. Walk often. A good target is 10,000 steps a day. Take the stairs. Park your car far away from your destination.</p>
          <li><b>Visit Your Doctor</b></li>
          <p></p>
          <p>Get regular checkups. Your doctor keeps track of your medical history and can help you stay healthy. For example, if you're at risk for osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones, they may want you to get more calcium and vitamin D.</p>
          <p>Your doctor may recommend screening tests to keep an eye on your health and catch conditions early when they're easier to treat.</p>
          <li><b>Cut Down Your Stress</b></li>
          <p></p>
          <p>It can take a toll on your health. You probably can't avoid it altogether, but you can find ways to ease the impact. Don't take on too much. Try to set limits with yourself and others. It's OK to say no.</p>
        
          <li><b>Safe medication use</b></li>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is important that you use your medicine as directed. Your medicine may not work if you don't follow the directions. Talking too much or too little can make you sick.

            Read the directions on the label and ask your healthcare provider how much you should take and when to take it.
            Only take the suggested dose.
            Do not stop taking your medicines without asking your healthcare provider, even if your symptoms go away.
            Learn how to read the drug facts label for the over-the-counter medicines.</p>
